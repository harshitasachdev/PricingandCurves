•	Implemented analytical pricing models (Black-Scholes, Bachelier, Black-76, Displaced Diffusion) to value European and digital options using Python. 
•	Calibrated SABR and Displaced Diffusion models to SPX and SPY option data across maturities using market implied volatilities; analyzed the impact of beta, rho and nu on volatility smiles. 
•	Priced exotic European payoffs and model-free implied variance using static replication and Carr-Madan approach under BS, Bachelier and SABR frameworks. 
•	Developed and simulated delta-hedging strategies under Black-Scholes dynamics using 50,000 Monte Carlo paths; analyzed hedging error distribution and convergence across hedge frequencies (N=21 vs 84).
•	Automated data preprocessing and interpolation of zero rates, forward prices and implied vol surfaces in Python for calibration and valuation workflows.
